### Hi there 👋

I'm Brandon Wolfson, a machine learning engineer excited about deep learning and human learning! I attended UCLA where I studied computational mathematics and performed improv comedy! 🎭

- 🔭 I’m currently working on applying deep learning to space! 🌠
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PyTorch and Fast.ai and trying to win Kaggle contests! 🏆
- 💬 Ask me about Fast.ai!
